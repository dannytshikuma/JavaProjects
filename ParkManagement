| Project – Task allocation system                                                                     |
| The manager of Mesozoic Eden needs a systematic way of managing the team and ensuring all tasks      |
| are efficiently accomplished.                                                                        |
| Design a simple program that assigns tasks to the Mesozoic Eden employees based on their roles (for  |
| example, Feedd, cleaning, security, and tour guiding). The program should decide tasks based on    |
| time, the employee’s role, and other factors, such as the park’s safety rating.                      |
| This program would not only help streamline operations but also ensure the safety and satisfaction   |
| of our staff, visitors, and, most importantly, our dinosaurs!                                        |
